Mobile development has been something that has avoided me over the years because of cool web frameworks like [foundation](http://www.foundation.com/) and [bootstrap](http://www.bootstrap.com/) with their focus on mobile first
I am Andrew Hoefling and I am a Software Engineer. This is my introduction blog post about my development blog. I am a C#/.NET expert or at least I play one on TV and I want to share my knowledge with co-workers and anyone that stumbles upon my little corner of the web. 

This blog is going to link to personal projects, other blogs, [stackoverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com/), detailed how-to guides and anything else that is around the 1's and 0's I stumble through. I may even make a bunch of corny jokes like that.
