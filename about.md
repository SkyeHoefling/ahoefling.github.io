I am a Software Engineer Consultant for [Surge](http://www.surgeforware.com/) and my own business Hoefling Software. Recently I was recommended by a colleague to start a development blog to document and share some of my findings as I explore new technologies and overcome issues.

The goal of this blog is to document new issues I overcome and talk about new technology that I work with on a daily basis.
